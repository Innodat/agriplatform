# Progress — Baseline Snapshot
Date: 2025‑08‑15 11:53 SAST
Module: Finance → Receipt Capturing
Author: Christoff

## Current State (Baseline)
- **Frontend**:
  - Single file: `page.tsx` (Vercel v0‑generated dashboard prototype)
  - No modular components extracted yet
  - Tailwind styling present; not yet ShadCN componentised
  - Role-based UI logic in‑line (Admin vs Employee)
  - Uses static mock data arrays
  - Tabs: Overview, Today, Admin (admin‑only)

- **Backend**:
  - Direct Supabase calls from frontend planned (no custom backend service yet)
  - Supabase MCP configured in Cline but not yet leveraged for schema‑driven components
  - No FastAPI/Python backend in place at this stage

- **Schemas**:
  - No Zod schemas implemented
  - No Pydantic models (no separate backend)
  - MCP schema fetch capability available, unused so far

- **Layouts**:
  - No global `<AppShell>` or `<FinanceLayout>` yet
  - No centralised routing structure defined (React Router planned)
  - Navigation limited to Tabs within single page

## Completed Tasks ✔

### Initial Modularization (2025-08-17)
- ✔ **Component Architecture**: Extracted modular components from monolithic page.tsx
- ✔ **Layout Structure**: Created AppShell with header, sidebar, and main content area
- ✔ **Department Navigation**: Implemented sidebar with Finance, Operations, Inventory departments
- ✔ **Module Organization**: Built Finance department with Receipt Capturing module
- ✔ **Page Components**: Created OverviewPage, TodayPage, and AdminPage components
- ✔ **Role-based Access**: Implemented admin-only tab visibility
- ✔ **Tab Navigation**: Fixed tab switching functionality with proper state management
- ✔ **UI Components**: Integrated ShadCN UI components (Card, Table, Button, Badge, Dialog)
- ✔ **React 19 Compatibility**: Resolved hook errors by replacing incompatible Radix UI components
- ✔ **Professional Styling**: Applied consistent Tailwind CSS styling throughout

### Tab Navigation Fix (2025-08-18)
- ✔ **Tab State Management**: Implemented useState for activeTab switching
- ✔ **Role Gating**: Admin Panel tab only visible to admin users
- ✔ **Component Integration**: Connected existing OverviewPage, TodayPage, AdminPage components
- ✔ **Interactive Navigation**: Tabs now properly switch content views on click
- ✔ **Visual Feedback**: Active tab highlighting with proper CSS classes

## Planned Next Steps (as per approved system patterns)
1. Run **PLAN** mode with Supabase MCP:
   - Generate live `receipts` table Zod schema
   - Design ASCII layout + route map (canonical pattern)
   - Identify shared vs feature‑local components

2. Approve layout (`APPROVE LAYOUT: yes`).

3. Run **ACT** mode:
   - Scaffold `/layouts` (AppShell, FinanceLayout)
   - Scaffold `/components` (shared) and `/modules/finance/receipt-capturing/components` (feature‑local)
   - Integrate Zod schema into ReceiptForm and Supabase queries

4. Confirm scaffolding before wiring Supabase mutations.

## Dual‑Schema Sync Checklist Status
- Frontend Zod: ❌ (not yet generated)
- Backend Pydantic: N/A (no separate backend yet)
- Sync: N/A at this stage
- Validation locations:
  - FE forms: ❌
  - BE endpoints: N/A

## Post‑ACT Update – 2025‑08‑18

### What Was Delivered
- **Complete Modular Architecture**: Successfully transformed monolithic page.tsx into scalable component-based structure
- **Functional Tab Navigation**: All three tabs (Overview, Today's Receipts, Admin Panel) now work correctly
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin Panel tab properly hidden for non-admin users
- **Professional UI**: Clean, enterprise-ready interface with proper styling and layout
- **React 19 Compatibility**: Resolved all React hook errors and compatibility issues

### Deviations from Original Plan
- **Simplified UI Components**: Used native HTML selects instead of Radix UI Select components due to React 19 compatibility issues
- **Direct Implementation**: Bypassed intermediate scaffolding steps to deliver working solution faster
- **Integrated Approach**: Combined layout and component creation in single implementation phase

### Current Architecture
```

├── App.tsx (Main application with tab navigation)
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── AppShell.tsx
│   │   ├── Topbar.tsx
│   │   └── Sidebar.tsx
│   └── finance/

│           └── components/
│               └── AddReceiptDialog.tsx ✔
```

### Remaining TODOs
- **Supabase Integration**: Connect live database queries to replace mock data
- **Zod Schema Generation**: Create type-safe schemas from Supabase MCP
- **Form Validation**: Implement proper form validation in AddReceiptDialog
- **React Router**: Add proper routing for scalable navigation
- **Authentication**: Integrate real user authentication and role management

## Notes
- This baseline will be used as the "before" snapshot for this module.
- Future updates to this file will mark ✔ for completed tasks and add dates.
- Any schema change in Supabase → regenerate Zod; if FastAPI added later → sync with Pydantic.
